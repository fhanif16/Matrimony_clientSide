# Matrimonial Website

## Project Description
I have developed a Matrimonial Website where users can:

1. **Update Biodata**:
   - Users can create, edit, and update their biodata to share their details, preferences, and other relevant information.

2. **Find Matches**:
   - The platform allows users to search for potential matches based on various criteria, making it easier to find compatible partners.

## Key Features

### Biodata Management
- Users can create a personalized biodata with fields like:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Gender

  - Profession
  - Contact Information
- Options to update or delete biodata are available.

### Matchmaking
- Advanced search filters to find matches based on:
  - Age range
  - Location
  - Profession
  - Other preferences
- View detailed profiles of potential matches.

### Contact Requests
- Users can send and receive contact requests.
- Admins or users can approve/reject requests.
